########Final Project Proposal

For my final project I was looking to take inspiration for cryptic augmented reality websites. Breadcrumbs and puzzles would lead a user on a journey from site to site where new clues would be given and the key or link to the next page would have to be discovered in new ways. Such as hiding morse code that must be deciphered in a photo, having the user come up with the next number in a sequence, matching different css color and animation patterns. The point is to create a puzzle game that while a game keeps the trappings of the web and by subverting expectations of a site would inspire the user to continue. One idea would be to do the site in node and angular and use increasing session security as the level gate.


###### Alternate Proposal

In keeping with my interest in games I have some experience with Unity 3d (I took a class in it a year or so ago, it wasnt very intense but I got the basics) and alternately would love to actually flesh out a game in this. The idea would be to use the 2d engine which I am not that familiar with but interested in none the less.
